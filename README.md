Arduino and Lego train: Traffic light and Infra-Red where Lego train is automated

Robotics Hobby Project: Arduino with Lego trains. 

Some of the Lego trains work with Infra-Red Sensors. Combining an Arduino board with little bit of programming and Infra-Red Sensors you can control your Lego train. I used a Photoresistor to determine the position of the train and used normal LEDs for the traffic lights.
