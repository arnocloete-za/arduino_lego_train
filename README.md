<b>Arduino and Lego train: Traffic light and Infra-Red where Lego train is automated</b>

 Robotics Hobby Project: Arduino with Lego trains.

 This is the Arduino code you would need for this project.

Some of the Lego trains work with Infra-Red Sensors. Combining an Arduino board with little bit of programming and Infra-Red Sensors you can control your Lego train. I used a Photoresistor to determine the position of the train and used normal LEDs for the traffic lights.
